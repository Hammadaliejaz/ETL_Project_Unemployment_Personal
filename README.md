# ETL-Unemployment

Extraction

Three data sets were used from 2 sources ( Kaggle and Data World). Counties from different States throughout the United States were analayzed over the period of 5 years from 2010-2015.

Transformation

Data cleaning was performed to only get data required for the analysis.

Load

All the data was loaded into a data base. Required tables were matched to the relevant columns. Finally SQLAlchemy was used to connect Database and load the result.
